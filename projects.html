									27-floor external facade is wrapped in a natural vine covered
									sunscreen. It has 1,793 large planter boxes, and four large
									structural cores that allow for good cross ventilation
									reducing the overall energy cost. Designed by WOHA and
									completed in 2016, the hotel is home to over 33 species of
									plants and 21 species of creepers.

									The restaurant’s interiors reflect 'zero-waste' ideology and
									Nina+Co created a gorgeous space which has Mycellium pendant
									lights hanging over a Mycellium chair with a table made from
									recycled plastic and sustainably sourced wood. Guests can
									enjoy a cocktail at the fluted bar counter which is made from
									recycled plastic packaging. The wall lamps are made by a local
									artisan from recycled wine bottles, netted sheeps wool lines

								<h3 class="inspiring-gallery">Earthship, Brighton</h3>
								<p class="inspiring-projects">
									<p>It is a self-sustainable building, completed in 2006 and owned by
										the Low Carbon Trust (a non-profit organisation), and situated
										in Stanmer Park, Brighton.</p>
					
									<p>The building is an example of passive solar earth sheltered
										design and was constructed using waste car tyres and other
										recycled materials, such as cans and bottles. The structure
										incorporates rammed earth tyres, renewable power systems and
										rainwater harvesting.
									</p>
									
									<p>	It uses the planet’s natural systems to
										provide heat, power and water and is designed to work as an
										autonomous building. The Low Carbon Trust (originally the Low
										Carbon Network) crew were trained by Mike Reynolds, who
										designed the Earthship structure and is the founder of
										Earthship Biotecture. Earthship Brighton is currently one of
										only two Earthships in the UK, and was the first Earthship to
										be built in England. Earthship Brighton is used as a community
										and environmental education centre, with regular guided tours
										for the public. It is used as a venue for various green
										building courses, including a three-day course on
										‘Self-building an Earthship’. In 2007, a book was written
										about the project: “Earthships: building a zero carbon future
										for homes”. A second edition "Earthships in Europe" was
										published in 2012, which features case studies of earthships
										in France, Spain, and the UK. There is also an in depth
										analysis of the thermal performance of the earthship in a
										temperate climate.</p>
